# Implementation Plan for Integrating Multicore Beamformer Particle Filter (BPF) into Deep Learning Model

## Overview
This implementation plan outlines the steps required to integrate the multicore beamformer particle filter (BPF) approach into the existing deep learning model for the deep-brain robotics project. The goal is to enhance the model's ability to localize EEG sources, particularly in the presence of noise and correlated sources, as described in the research paper "A Beamformer-Particle Filter Framework for Localization of Correlated EEG Sources."

## Steps

### 1. Integrate Multicore BPF Approach
- **Objective**: Implement the multicore BPF approach for estimating the spatial locations and waveforms of brain sources.
- **Actions**:
  - Define the state-space model for EEG source localization based on physiological constraints.
  - Implement the EEG measurement model to relate the EEG signals measured at the scalp to the underlying brain sources.
  - Implement the EEG state transition model, assuming no prior knowledge of source locations and modeling the state transition as a random walk.
  - Develop the multicore beamforming approach for correlated source localization, addressing the limitations of conventional beamforming.

### 2. Adapt Existing Deep Learning Model
- **Objective**: Adapt the current deep learning model to incorporate the multicore BPF approach.
- **Actions**:
  - Modify the `deep_learning_model.py` script to include the multicore BPF methodology.
  - Integrate the state-space model, measurement model, and state transition model into the existing model architecture.
  - Update the model's training and prediction functions to utilize the multicore BPF approach.

### 3. Parameter Tuning and Validation
- **Objective**: Tune the model parameters and validate the model's performance using simulation results and methodologies from the research paper.
- **Actions**:
  - Use the simulation parameters described in the paper (e.g., dipole coordinates, signal frequencies, SNR levels) to inform the model's parameter tuning.
  - Conduct validation experiments using both generated and real EEG data to ensure the model's accuracy and robustness.
  - Compare the model's performance with the results presented in the paper to verify its effectiveness.

### 4. Testing and Evaluation
- **Objective**: Test the integrated model and evaluate its performance in real-world scenarios.
- **Actions**:
  - Develop test cases to evaluate the model's ability to localize EEG sources in various conditions (e.g., different levels of source correlation, SNR levels).
  - Conduct experiments using real EEG data, similar to the visual stimuli experiments described in the paper.
  - Analyze the model's performance and make necessary adjustments to improve its accuracy and efficiency.

## Timeline
- **Week 1**: Integrate the multicore BPF approach and adapt the existing deep learning model.
- **Week 2**: Tune model parameters and conduct validation experiments using simulation data.
- **Week 3**: Test the integrated model using real EEG data and evaluate its performance.
- **Week 4**: Finalize the model, document the implementation process, and prepare for deployment.

## Documentation
- **Objective**: Document the implementation process, including code changes, methodologies, and validation results.
- **Actions**:
  - Update the `DOCUMENTATION.md` file with detailed descriptions of the multicore BPF approach and its integration into the model.
  - Include references to the research paper and any other relevant sources.
  - Provide clear instructions for running the model and conducting validation experiments.

## Conclusion
This implementation plan provides a structured approach to integrating the multicore BPF approach into the deep learning model for the deep-brain robotics project. By following these steps, we aim to enhance the model's ability to accurately localize EEG sources, even in challenging conditions, and validate its performance using both simulated and real EEG data.
