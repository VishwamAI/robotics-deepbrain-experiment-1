# robotics-deepbrain-experiment-1

## Introduction
This project, `deepbrain-experiment-1`, is part of an experiment for future sustainability of human faces. It involves developing an advanced deep learning model for deep-brain robotics and creating a 2D imagination hologram experience that interacts with the brain.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VishwamAI/robotics-deepbrain-experiment-1.git
   cd robotics-deepbrain-experiment-1
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
