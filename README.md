## Capabilities of the Deep Brain Model
The deep brain model developed in this project incorporates advanced techniques to address the project's goals. Key capabilities include:

- **Multicore Beamformer Particle Filter (BPF) Approach**: The model uses a multicore BPF approach for EEG source localization, enabling accurate estimation of source locations and waveforms.
- **LSTM Layers for Temporal Dynamics**: The model includes LSTM layers to capture temporal dynamics in the EEG signals, improving the model's ability to interpret brain activity over time.
- **Error Handling and Input Validation**: The model includes detailed logging, error handling, and input validation to ensure robustness and reliability.
- **Sample Data Generation**: The `generate_sample_data.py` script processes multiple signal files from the `datasets/` directory, reshapes the data, and generates sample data for training and testing the model.
- **Model Training and Prediction**: The model can be trained using the `train_model` function and make predictions using the `predict` function, demonstrating its ability to interpret EEG data and generate meaningful outputs.
